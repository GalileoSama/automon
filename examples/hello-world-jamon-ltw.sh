# The following executes the HelloWorld using load time weaving (ltw).  The aspectj javaagent is required.
# ltw is the most flexible way of using aspectj and is controled by passing an aspectj xml config line into the program.
# The example monitors a class using Jamon as opposed to sysout which is used in the other examples.  Monitoring with
# Yammer Metrics or JavaSimon could be done in a similar way. Note -Dorg.automon=jamon is not specified below.  Instead
# Automon recognizes that Jamon is available and so uses it.
